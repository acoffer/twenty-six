March 2, 2018 will be the next meeting of the Rockbridge 2600 group.  Come get some **FREE PIZZA** and listen to a talk on the [Bash shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)).  If you wanna run [linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux), and you should, than you need to know something about Bash.
