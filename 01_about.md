### -**What is a Rockbridge 2600 group?**

A 2600 group is a **"grey hat"** hacking group.

### -**What's "grey hat" hacking?**

The word "Hacking" has a strongly negative conotation for the general population.  It is often assocated with criminal activity pertaining to computer technology. However, hacking can have a much broader meaning.

>*Hacking:*
>
>"any sort of technological utilization or manipulation of technology which goes above and beyond the capabilities inherent to the design of a given application."

In other words, hacking is not just limited to computers and criminaly activity.  Any DIY project that modifies some technology would be considered "hacking".  This type of hacking is often defined as "grey hat".  

There is also "white hat" and "black hat" hacking.  "white hat" hacking is related to cybersecurity and "black hat" hacking is related to cybercrime.

### -**What does "2600" mean?** 

2600 is a refrence to one of the earlist modern exploits used by hackers.  

>The origins of 2600 "trace back at least to AT&T's implementation of fully automatic switches. These switches used tone dialing, a form of in-band signaling, and included some tones which were for internal telephone company use.[citation needed] One internal-use tone was a tone of 2600 Hz which caused a telephone switch to think the call had ended, leaving an open carrier line, which could be exploited to provide free long-distance, and international, calls. At that time, long-distance calls were quite expensive.
>
>The tone was discovered in approximately 1957, by Joe Engressia, a blind seven-year-old boy. Engressia had perfect pitch, and discovered that whistling the fourth E above middle C (a frequency of 2600 Hz) would stop a dialed phone recording. Unaware of what he had done, Engressia called the phone-company and asked why the recordings had stopped. Joe Engressia is considered to be the father of phreaking.
>
>Other early phreaks, such as "Bill from New York" (William "Bill" Acker 1953-2015), began to develop a rudimentary understanding of how phone networks worked. Bill discovered that a recorder he owned could also play the tone at 2600 Hz with the same effect. John Draper discovered through his friendship with Engressia that the free whistles given out in Cap'n Crunch cereal boxes also produced a 2600 Hz tone when blown (providing his nickname, "Captain Crunch"). This allowed control of phone systems that worked on single frequency (SF) controls. One could sound a long whistle to reset the line, followed by groups of whistles (a short tone for a "1", two for a "2", etc.) to dial numbers."

This type of hacking is known as ["phreaking"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phreaking#2600_hertz) and is one of the oldest forms of modern hacking.
